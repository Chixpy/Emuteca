This script adds a semitransparent border around the content of a image.

Use mainly for icons and logos, but it's very slow.

You can use ETKIconBorder.exe to do the same thing very much faster. It has simple tools to paint or fill transparent background pixels too.

How to install
--------------

  1. Copy icon-border.scm in a Gimp script folder. (You can see wich folders are used in Edit/Preferences men√∫, then Folders/Scripts.)
  2. Update the plugins/filters in Filters/Script-Fu/Reload Scripts.

A new menu entry will aparear in Filters menu: Add Icon Border...

How to use
----------

Easy way...

  1. Load the image.
  2. Make transparent the background of the image where the border will be drawn.
  3. Run the script.

In depth:

  - Only active layer will be used.
  - Image must have alpha channel: Layer/Transparency/Add Alpha Channel (or Right-click over the layer).
  - Image must be RGB (8bits): Image/Mode/RGB

After saving the image with Gimp, it's recommended to used a png optimizer with the file. For example:

  * http://psydk.org/pngoptimizer or
    https://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/pngoptimizer-portable
  * DON'T USE: Irfanview (it will mess with transparency...), but you can use PNGOut directly

Options
-------

* Border color: Color to use for border.
* Border opacity: Opacity of border.
