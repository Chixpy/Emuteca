@title(Emuteca's source code documentation)

Here is the documentation of the Emuteca's source code. 

@html(<a href="http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/PasDoc">PasDoc</a>) was selected
for documentation by two reasons:

@orderedList(
  @item(I don't like Lazarus' LazDoc with the comments in other file.)
  @item(Lazarus itself recognizes PasDoc comments, specially @code({<) to show
    them in tooltips (I like the comments after the declarations, but before
    the implementation). Then, when the mouse pointer is over something the
    tooltips are not messed with the previous thing declared.)
)

Previously, when Delphi was used for compilation, 
@html(<a href="http://delphidoc.sourceforge.net/">JADD</a>) has been used.
Maybe it's more powerfull as you can more things that to document the code;
for example, to do the user's manual or the offline help...
