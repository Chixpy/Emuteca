This is a miscellaneous list for developing and other thing related.

7z = Folder or 7z/zip/rar/etc.
db = Whatever I store the full list of game/parents

(0.8) Games or Software folder?
------------------------
Software. Many systems have not only games.

(0.8) How store things?
-----------------------
Think about store all extra info about a game inside the same 7z rather than
"MultiOmniFolderSpreadedIn7z" as now is...:
  * Game (+ Clones): In 1 7z (as usual, nothing new)
    * Win: All game files
    * MAME: Split
    * Whatever: No change
  * Basic info in db (for lists. Less info stored, faster reading).
  * Tags in MAME style. A file with IDs listed, not every clone/parent
    has its own tags.
  * Images, Text, Sound, etc.: ALL in 1 7z (or kind-splited)
  * TOSEC/User data: Not sure... Maybe external file, or one stored in the
    previous 7z. This a per Clone info, while Images/Text is for parent...

Pros:
  * Less waiting while uncompressing media, 7z faster search.
  * Easy exporting/importing extra data.
  * If one day I made a grafical UI, most of data really, really will not be
    loaded until a game is selected. The main problem in Emuteca is the main
    list categorization (we need all data loaded to categorize by License
    for example).

Cons:
  * Nobody has this schema.
  * Some things may be better in raw form (Icons, TOSEC) for the list usage.

Not sure Pros/Cons:
  * System configuration about Images/Texts... folder and captions, for example.
  * And what about media manager?



(0.8) Sorting and Trasliteration of game names
----------------------------------------------

Game Clone data
---------------
  * Basic info (Stored straight in db) for listings:
    * ID
    * Title
    * Version (and release type: beta, alpha, proto)
    * DumpStatus (TOSEC)
    * Year
    * Zone
    * Publisher
    * Parent
    * Path/Folder/zip/7z
    * FileName

  * Stored as tags:
    * Year of developing
    * Developer

  * Additional (This maybe loaded from an external file, but some seems to be
    useful in main list...)
    * TOSEC (Languages)
    * Tags (Generic categorization info, remember: Language, License)
    * User info
      * Rating
      * Quick notes
      * Â¿Some other?
