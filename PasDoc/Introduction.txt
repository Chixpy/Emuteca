Emuteca is split in two subprojects:

@definitionList(
  @itemLabel(Emuteca Core: cEmuteca)
    @item(It is the database engine and some sample forms.)
  @itemLabel(Emuteca GUI: TfmETKGUIMain@)
    @item(It is a full working GUI and database editor with media support.)
)

In the future, may be an SDL GUI only for playing will be developed.
